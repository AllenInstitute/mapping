Documentation for Clare Morris, Informatics and Data Science intern at Allen Institute for Brain Science. 

This repository contains scripts and results from my work in the summer of 2022. 

Code: contains functions that I often ran to analyze mapping results

Notebooks: "scratch" scripts used 

Results: dataframes and slides summarizing results of my work comparing flat and HKNN mapping algorithms.

This Github repository does not contain the actual R objects with results as the files are too large-- those can be found in the /allen drive under "Y:\allen\programs\celltypes\workgroups\rnaseqanalysis\clare_morris\r_objects"
